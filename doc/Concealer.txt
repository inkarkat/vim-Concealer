DESCRIPTION					       *Concealer-description*

Ever tried exploring a log file or complex configuration, and struggling to
distinguish between 58343925-ae76-41f5-bf6e-4048484d9a5f and
58343925-ae77-41f5-bf6e-404848489a5f, or trying to see the gist among 128-char
security token monsters, IPv6 addresses, object IDs?

This plugin adds mappings and commands to conceal the current word, selection,
or regular expression pattern matches on the fly. Either globally, or just
inside the current window, each concealed text is condensed to a single
special character (or hidden completely).
Via [count], additional alternatives can be added / removed to the global
conceal groups; the window-local groups instead allow quick and easy toggling.
Since the text is only concealed, this doesn't touch the actual buffer
contents, can be toggled on/off, and as a bonus there's even a command to list
all defined groups and active patterns.

HOW IT WORKS								     *

This plugin is based on the |conceal| feature introduced in Vim 7.3.

SEE ALSO								     *

- mark.vim (vimscript #2666) also offers mappings and commands to highlight,
  not conceal, several patterns in different colors simultaneously.
  If you just want to differentiate multiple patterns (without shrinking their
  visual representation), use this plugin.
- SearchAlternatives.vim (vimscript #4146) can also add and subtract
  alternatives via mappings and commands, but to the search pattern, not
  different conceal groups.
- FoldCol (http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#FOLDCOL) can fold
  away a blockwise visual selection in a buffer.

RELATED WORKS								     *

==============================================================================
USAGE							     *Concealer-usage*

The Concealer offers both global and buffer-local hiding of certain text /
regular expression matches. The former works like search highlighting; it
applies to each buffer in every open window. The latter is only defined for
the current buffer, and conceal defaults are only applied to the current
window, so even window splits of the same buffer won't show a difference until
you enable concealing in those windows, too.

Global concealing offers finer control, using [count] to add and remove
alternatives to the conceal group. Use it to create long-lived highlights and
multi-buffer investigations. On the other hand, buffer-local concealing is
accessible via a single simple toggle mapping, and is just right when you want
to quickly get rid of a particular text fragment right there and now.


{Visual}[count]<Leader>X+			   *<Leader>X+* *v_<Leader>X+*
[count]<Leader>X+	Globally conceal the current whole \<word\> (similar
			to the |star| command) / the selected text.
			Without [count], the next free conceal group is used.
			With [count], adds the pattern to the conceal group
			[count] instead.
			Concealment applies to all buffers. To conceal only in
			the current buffer, use |<Leader>XX|.
						   *<Leader>X-* *v_<Leader>X-*
<Leader>X-		Stop concealing the current whole \<word\> / selected
{Visual}<Leader>X-	text everywhere. Also removes this alternative from
			any conceal group that contains it.
[count]<Leader>X-	Stop concealing (all patterns in) conceal group
			[count].
{Visual}<Leader>X-

						   *<Leader>XX* *v_<Leader>XX*
<Leader>XX		In the current buffer, toggle concealing the current
			whole \<word\> (similar to the |star| command) / the
			selected text.
			Without [count], the next free conceal group is used.
			Concealment only applies to the current buffer. To
			conceal globally in all buffers, or to selectively
			add or remove patterns to individual conceal groups,
			use |<Leader>X+| / |<Leader>X-|.
			To remove all buffer-local conceal groups, you can use
			|:ConcealHere!|.
								*:ConcealHere*
:[count]ConcealHere {expr}
			In the current buffer, conceal {expr}.
			Without [count], the next free conceal group is used.
			With [count], uses conceal group [count] instead (and
			clears any text previously concealed by that group).
			Concealment only applies to the current buffer. To
			conceal globally in all buffers, or to selectively
			remove patterns or individual conceal groups, use
			|:ConcealAdd| / |:ConcealRemove|.
:[count]ConcealHere!	In the current buffer, stop concealing local group
			[count] / all local groups defined by |:ConcealHere|
			and <Leader>XX.
:[count]ConcealHere! {expr}
			In the current buffer, toggle concealing {expr}: If
			a / the conceal group [count] contains {expr}, it is
			cleared; else, it starts concealing {expr}.

								 *:ConcealAdd*
:[count]ConcealAdd {expr}
			Globally conceal {expr}.
			Without [count], the next free conceal group is used.
			With [count], adds the pattern to the conceal group
			[count] instead.
			Concealment applies to all buffers. To conceal only in
			the current buffer, use |:ConcealHere|.
							      *:ConcealRemove*
:ConcealRemove {expr}	Stop concealing {expr} everywhere.
:[count]ConcealRemove	Stop concealing any patterns in conceal group [count].
:ConcealRemove!		Stop concealing anything by any global conceal group.

								   *:Conceals*
:Conceals		List all conceal groups and the patterns defined for
			them. The group number (for use as [count]), conceal
			character and pattern are listed.
			Unless there are buffer-local conceals, all global
			groups are always listed (even when empty) so that you
			can easily choose a proper group for easier recall.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					      *Concealer-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim Concealer*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					      *Concealer-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.3 or higher with the |+conceal| feature.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.020 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					     *Concealer-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

For the first 11 conceal groups, different conceal characters (|:syn-cchar|)
are preset to allow easy recognition of the concealed areas. All additional
groups get the default conceal character defined in the 'listchars' option, or
are completely hidden, depending on 'conceallevel').

		*g:Concealer_Characters_Global* *g:Concealer_Characters_Local*
As conceal characters, when possible, special characteristic Unicode
characters are choosen. To change the set or number of characters: >
    let g:Concealer_Characters_Global = '!@#$%^&*()_'
    let g:Concealer_Characters_Local = '1234567890_'
<
						    *g:Concealer_ConcealLevel*
By default, concealing is off; but Concealer automatically presets
'conceallevel' when conceal groups are used, so that you immediately see the
effects without manually reconfiguring concealment. This preset is applied
only to the current window for local conceal groups, and to all windows once
there have been global conceal groups. To disable the default preset: >
    let g:Concealer_ConcealLevel = 0
To completely hide the text, without conceal char: >
    let g:Concealer_ConcealLevel = 3
<						   *g:Concealer_ConcealCursor*
Likewise, to change the 'concealcursor' preset: >
    let g:Concealer_ConcealCursor = 'nv'
<
==============================================================================
INTEGRATION					       *Concealer-integration*

You can use Concealer#AddLocal() and Concealer#RemoveLocal() to define custom,
buffer-local concealments. This supports custom a:char. Choose a non-numeric,
alphabetic a:key to avoid interfering with the conceal groups defined by the
plugin. If you include an underscore character, the definition will be hidden
from the |:Conceals| output.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS					       *Concealer-limitations*

- As the conceal feature is bound to the syntax highlighting, the original
  filetype's syntax may interfere with Concealer, and vice versa. A workaround
  is to temporarily turn off the filetype's syntax either locally >
    :setl syn=
< or globally >
    :syntax off
